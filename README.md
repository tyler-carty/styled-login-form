# styled-login-form

 A stylised login form, built in C# using the Bunifu Framework, to give a simple and enjoyable user experience when loggin in to an application.

 A C# application that can be used alongside an application of the user's choice to provide login features.

 Built to communicate with a MySQL database for the login procedure.

 In order to view code, open the solution (Pocket Book.sln) in Visual Studio. From there you can modify the code base to match your application, or run as is.

 Thank you!
